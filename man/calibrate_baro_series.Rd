\usage{
calibrate_baro_series(
  wide_press,
  baro_cols = NULL,
  ref_col = NULL,
  min_overlap = 20L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{wide_press}{A wide data frame containing a \code{timestamp} column
and one column per barometric station specified in \code{baro_cols}.}

\item{baro_cols}{Character vector of column names in \code{wide_press}
representing barometric series.}

\item{ref_col}{Name of the reference barometric column in \code{wide_press}
to which all other series will be aligned.}

\item{min_overlap}{Integer; minimum number of overlapping points required
between the reference and an alternate series before regression-based
adjustment is considered reliable. A warning is issued if overlap is
fewer than this.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{wide_press}: the input data frame with additional
\code{"<baro_col>_adj"} columns containing adjusted series, including
an adjusted copy of the reference column.
\item \code{reg_summary}: a data frame summarizing the regression used
for each alternate series (columns include \code{alt_col},
\code{ref_col}, \code{n_overlap}, \code{intercept}, \code{slope},
and \code{r2}).
}
}
\description{
Adjusts one or more barometric pressure time series to the scale of a
reference series using simple linear regression, and returns adjusted
columns along with regression diagnostics. Typically used internally by
\code{add_nearest_baro()} to place multiple barometric stations onto a
common reference scale.
