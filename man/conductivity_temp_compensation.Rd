\title{Apply temperature compensation to conductivity measurements}
\usage{
conductivity_temp_compensation(input_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{Data frame containing conductivity data with columns
\code{conduct_uScm_adj} (adjusted conductivity in µS/cm) and \code{watertemp_C_adj}
(adjusted water temperature in \u00B0C).}
}
\value{
The input data frame with an additional column \code{spc_uScm_adj}
containing specific conductance (temperature-compensated conductivity
values) normalized to 25\u00B0C.
}
\description{
Adjusts conductivity values to a standard reference temperature (typically 25\u00B0C)
using temperature compensation coefficients based on ISO 7888. This corrects
for the effect of temperature on conductivity measurements.
}
\details{
The function uses a 5th-order polynomial fitted to ISO 7888 temperature
compensation coefficients. The compensation is applied row-wise based on
the water temperature at each measurement.

Temperature compensation formula:
\deqn{C_{25} = C_T / f(T)}

where \eqn{C_T} is conductivity at temperature T, \eqn{C_{25}} is conductivity
at 25\u00B0C, and \eqn{f(T)} is the temperature compensation coefficient.
